# Business Time
## CodeFellows iOS 401 Final Project - Front End

* Team Name: Business Time
* Front-End iOS code by: Eve Denison and Alex Cahn
* Back-End Javascript server code by: Patick Sheridan, Michael Treat, Lindsay Gilbert, Disa Marnesdottr, and Isak Swearingen
* Project Concept: Application that allows users to create, organize, and share digital business cards on a mobile iOS device.

### Project Domain Model:
---

This project aims to simplify the networking process for developers.  In the app you can create your own business card from our sleek template and save as many business cards as you would like. You can then send your eco-friendly business card to whomever you choose via text-message, email, or airdrop. Save time, money, decrease environmental impact, and enjoy convenience around networking.

### Minimum Viable Product
---

* iCloud verification doesn't require a user to have to login or sign-up. A unique token is passed to the back end, so no personal information is exchanged.
* Card creation page that takes text input and takes a snapshot of completed card.
* Stores card to database and saves in “My Cards” collection view.
* Cards in collection view: swipe to delete, and long press to share(via text, email, or airdrop) cards.

### Stretch Goals:
---

* Different business card fonts and templates. Ability to add notes and/or photos/logos.
* Ability to message/call contacts.
* Meetup API integration to allow a user to search and sign up for meetups by programming language/location.


### Technology Use:
---

* Google docs for planning
* Github projects for task management
* Github for repo development
* Slack utilized for instant communication and links sharing
